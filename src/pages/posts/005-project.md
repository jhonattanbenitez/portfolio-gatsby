This is an eSport team page project, this one is personal as a hobby and it had an special value to me because it's about the video game that (League of Legends) i  love and it taught me a lot about deploying, hosting and optimization, started first with React for the Front-End and using the WordPress REST API as a headless CMS Back-End, then i moved the entire project to Gatsby.
